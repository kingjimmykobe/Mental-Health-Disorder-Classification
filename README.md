# Mental-Health-Disorder-Classification
This project involves analyzing a mental disorders dataset to identify patterns and differences in patient diagnoses and behaviors. We will clean the data, conduct exploratory analysis using visualizations, and perform hypothesis testing with tools like Python, Pandas, and SciPy to draw insights that could influence healthcare strategies.
