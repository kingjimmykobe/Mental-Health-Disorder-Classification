Project Title: Analysis and Hypothesis Testing on Mental Disorders Dataset
Project Description:
Objective: The primary goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of a dataset related to mental disorders. The project aims to clean the data, apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to understand the dataset's characteristics, and conduct hypothesis testing to investigate potential statistical differences between groups defined by their diagnoses.

Data Source: The dataset, presumably named 'Dataset-Mental-Disorders.csv', includes various attributes related to patients' diagnoses, behavioral responses, and demographic information.

Tools and Technologies:

Python: Main programming language used for the analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization including histograms and heatmaps.
SciPy: For conducting hypothesis testing (t-tests).
Sklearn: Specifically LabelEncoder for encoding categorical variables into numerical format.
Methodology:
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Missing Values Handling: Identify missing values across the dataset using isnull().sum() and fill missing numeric data with the mean of their respective columns. Categorical missing values, if any, could be handled by imputing the most frequent category or using a placeholder value.
Label Encoding: Categorical data that are non-numeric, such as diagnosis labels, are transformed into numerical format using LabelEncoder to facilitate further analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Statistical Summary: Utilize describe() to obtain a summary of statistics for numerical columns, providing insights into mean, median, mode, and standard deviations.
Distribution Analysis: Use histograms to visualize the distribution of the 'Expert Diagnose' column after label encoding to understand the frequency of each diagnosis.
Correlation Analysis: Generate a heatmap of the correlation matrix to explore potential relationships between different numeric variables in the dataset.
3. Hypothesis Testing:

Group Definition: Define groups based on unique values in the 'Expert Diagnose' column. The assumption here is that different diagnoses might influence other measurable attributes differently.
Statistical Test: Conduct a t-test between two groups to determine if there are statistically significant differences in another measured variable, providing evidence to support or reject hypotheses regarding the impact of different diagnoses.
4. Visualizations:

Histograms: To observe the frequency distribution of diagnoses.
Heatmap: To identify and visualize correlations between variables which can inform model building or further hypothesis testing.
Expected Outcomes:
Data Insights: Identification of missing or anomalous data and understanding of the general distribution
